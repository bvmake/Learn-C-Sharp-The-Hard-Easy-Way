Let's get started. You are going to need a few things and going to have to do some small chores before we can start coding in C#.

The first thing we'll need is LINQPad. It is a program that you can type C# code into and test it to see if it works. You can download it from [this page](http://www.linqpad.net/). The "Low Impact Setup" for .NET 4.0 (referred to as FW 4.0 on the linqpad site) is recommended.

Once LINQPad is installed on your computer, run it by clicking on the desktop icon (or on LINQPad.exe if you downloaded the zip file).
